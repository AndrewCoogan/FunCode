       "\"I think we should be able to play in a sport if we have a grade C. I think i would be not fear for student that have a good grade like c to play in a sport. If we had a D or an F i would understand that but a C i nothing. Not a lot of kid get A or Bs and if we do. Some of those kids don't like to play a sport they like to do all there homework not that i am saying that a bad C grade people do there homework to. If there is only 1 out of 4 percent of student that get A and B, They all don't like the same sports and some don't like to do sports so it wouldn't be a hole team in that sport. that means you would have to cancel all the sport teams in the school. That why you should let C student play an a sport.\""
